Variation in the apartment type is the core reason to blame. Here are the types of flats in today&#8217;s Dhaka.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Studio Style<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you want an open floor plan, a Studio style apartment flat is for you. Consisting of single rooms that combine the bedroom, living room, and kitchen. A separate room with a complete bathroom holds everything in place.<\/p>\n<p>An alcove studio and convertible studio are the two Studio style variations. Both of them quite similar, but the convertible type has rooms with a larger area. Here you can place a complete wall and make your own DIY room.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Micro Apartment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A Micro apartment is a one-room apartment, especially for students or bachelors. This type of flat apartment has sitting spaces, a sleeping bed, a bathroom, and a kitchen. The best part is, you have to pay less rent, due to the small room area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Loft\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Similar to the micro-apartment, a loft apartment also has a single room, but the area isn&#8217;t small. In fact, it has a high ceiling and high windows.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Duplex<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With a duplex flat, more than two families can live on its two separate units. If you want to live with your family, try searching for a Duplex apartment, having living spaces both up and downstairs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Triplex<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trying to fit three families in a single apartment? For those of you who have a joint family, they can try out triplex-style flats. It is kinda like a duplex apartment, with three units supporting an accommodation feature.<\/p>\n<p>How to pick a flat in Gulshan?<\/p>\n<p>Though there are tons of flat types, you still have to pick a good choice. For starters, a single room is best suited for a bachelor or someone living alone.\u00a0If you are a couple, try getting a flat with a big room or a single bedroom apartment with a large dining space. Renting a two-bedroom apartment will just increase the burden of maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>Now comes the fun part. A family of more than five should try out a big size apartment or a duplex apartment as they come with more convenience. You will find tons of Neighbors to talk to, and you kids can play with their kids.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You may Also like,<\/p>\n<p><strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/rents.com.bd\/area\/furnished-apartment-rent-in-gulshan\/\">Apartment Rent In Gulshan<\/a> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/rents.com.bd\/area\/commercial-space-rent-in-gulshan\/\">Commercial Space Rent In Gulshan<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rents.com.bd\/area\/house-rent-in-dhaka\/\"><strong>furnished house rent in dhaka<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rents.com.bd\/area\/flat-rent-in-dhaka\/\"><b>one room flat rent in dhaka<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The price of flat rents depends on factors like layout, location, storage space, and, yes, noise.
